# card-verification-task
#Explaination
i did a simple card verification where i used the readline library from node js to take in input from the user, in this case the input being the card number to verify
i wrote a function inside the callback function of the ri.question which takes a single argument in this case the card number, it also contains if elseif and else statments to return which card type the card number is.
i used the three common card types in nigeria i.e the mastercard, visa card and verve card as my use case 
They are further explaination in my code using comments
